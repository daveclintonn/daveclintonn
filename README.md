# Hey! Welcome Here

This ain't my main gig it's just where I mess around with open source stuff. Think of it like charity work... but with code. If you want the real action, head over to [**My Main GitHub**](https://github.com/daveclinton/daveclinton).

## My Portfolio  
Want to see what I can actually do when I’m sober (mostly)? Check out [**My Portfolio**](http://daveclintonn.cc/).

Fork it, star it, or just gawk. It’s all good.

Cheers,  
[David Clinton]
